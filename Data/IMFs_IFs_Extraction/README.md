# Extraction of the IMFs and the IFs 

In this folder, the code required to extract the IMFs and related IFs is provided. Note that, this extraction has been done through R rather than Python.
The main reasond to do so is that the R package provides more options in terms of the envelope constructions so to obtain a more reliable decomposotion technique.
For extra details see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EMD/index.html. 

For reason of space, the extracted bases and IFs are not uploaded but could be provided under requrest.
